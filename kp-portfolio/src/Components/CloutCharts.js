          <h1>The Current State of Streaming Services in 2020</h1>
          <p>
            There are countless stream services that exist on the internet that
            people visit to listen to music.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Streaming services have provided easier access to wide styles of
            music for people all over the world. Unfortunately, there are
            countless artists and bands who have not been discovered, thus
            creating a void for many different music genres and styles.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Even though there are platforms and blogs that give exposure to
            unique artists like Bandcamp or TinyMixtapes, it is still
            troublesome for most users to search for artists that still fly
            under the radar in the internet age.
          </p>

          <h1>Advocating Music Exploration with Clout Charts </h1>
          <p>
            Idealistically, Clout Charts aims to provide equal grounding for
            every artist while also exposing listeners to unique and diverse
            music selection.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            As the primary product designer on this project, I heavily focused
            on designing a unique experience that enables listeners to interact
            with artists and other listeners.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            After detailed research on understanding listeners and artists, our
            challenge became clear; create an easy to navigate music streaming
            exploration site that is unique for our listeners and enables
            interaction with all user roles.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            My team of designers began to unpack the challenge by scoping and
            conceptualizing how we could create a unique and user-friendly music
            exploration streaming platform.
          </p>
          <h4>Timeline</h4>
          <img src={timeline} alt="timeline" className="reg-img" />

          <h1>Original Solution</h1>
          <p>
            The original solution was to create a chart platform that shows all
            the collective streams an artist accrued across all music streaming
            services.{" "}
          </p>

          <h1>Problem with that Solution</h1>
          <p>
            After deep analysis through reading articles and blogs, the research
            team found the original solution to be flawed. Charts, lists, and
            genres do not always help artists and can hinder music exploration.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Although rankings and statistics can provide valuable data to
            artists and labels, in the long run, psychologically, these can
            create mental barriers for people to go beyond the charts and
            discover music by other artists.
          </p>

          <h1>Understanding How Users Listen to Music </h1>
          <p>
            After taking a step back and realizing our current missteps, our
            team decided to do an ethnographic/qualitative interview with people
            to see how they hear, consume, and discover music. During this time,
            we interviewed many age groups in vast cities: Atlanta, Houston,
            Oakland, Newyork, etc.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            My team interviewed age groups in between 17- 55, male and
            female.From our results, our survey found that most users discovered
            music through playlists and chart rankings.
          </p>

          <h4>Survey Results</h4>
          <img src={survey} alt="survey chart" className="reg-img" />

          <h1>Key Findings</h1>
          <p>
            While conducting interviews, it was interesting to learn not only
            how people discovered music, but learn their initial problems with
            streamings services and chart listings as well. It seems that people
            wanted to discover music out of curiosity, but ran into a couple of
            roadblocks throughout the process.

          <p>
            By doing a deep and thorough examination, our team asked the
            question of how we could create a unique and distinctive experience
            for any music listening type. The answer was clear from the start,
            go big or go home. The challenge was to create a platform that
            offered the best of all worlds on music streaming platforms and
            database sites.

          <h1>Gamifying Music Streaming</h1>
          <p>
            I wanted to create a music app that rewarded exploration and lauded
            music listeners with points. I got the idea from a YouTube video
            <mark className="quote-mark">
              "Gamification - How the Principles apply to real-life"

            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            It's surprising that no music streaming service hasn't yet created a
            Gamification concept, so I wanted to take swing with this ideal by
            brainstorming and observing many different methods of Gamification,
            where I could not only engage the listener, but empower them in the
            process ex: educating on music styles/sounds and exploring other
            cultures.

            arduous task -- but imagine if the songs/albums presented themselves
            to the users, based off feelings, art, and exploration rather than
            charts genres, and lists.

            In this section we showcased the userâ€™s search results based on
            their keywords. We also provided an alternative music section each

            Feed: for the Likes page, I wanted to have gamification designed
            based layout that encourages users to be competitive with one
            another to explore music.

            Based on user feedback, it was important to have the likes section
            not only displayed music that you liked, but also badges that award
            the user for exploration, stats on the music youâ€™re listening to,
            artist, company, and user connections updates.

            We just didnâ€™t want to create a regular search page but wanted to
            have a collage of albums that the user could scan. One of my
            teammates sought inspiration from the explore section on Instagram
            and basically wanted to do the same thing with album covers. This
            feature will have an infinite scroll and be based on unique album
            covers.

            Building the user dashboard wasnâ€™t an easy task, but our team pulled
            through and created something that could really disrupt the music
            industry and give users a product that could change the way they
            listen to consume and view music. For future releases we want to
            focus more is communities, music map, and the artists dashboard.

            Throughout this process, Iâ€™ve learned that listening to music should
            not be a task or a chore , but a journey for many people to take a
            part of. During the discovery phase, I was so focused on the process
            , that I missed key elements om what makes music listening fun.
